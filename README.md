# 📈 Market Cap Updater

A clean, beginner-friendly stock tracker app built with **React** and **Node.js/Express**. You can look up stock symbols like AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT and see current prices, basic info, and (when available) market cap and outstanding shares.

> ⚠️ Heads up: Free APIs like Yahoo Finance don’t always provide full data — things like **market cap** and **shares outstanding** may show as _N/A_. This is a known limitation and happens due to rate limits or missing data on the free tier.
